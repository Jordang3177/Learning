    <string name="AboutText">Sudoku is a logic-based number placement puzzle. Starting with a
    partially completed 9x9 grid, the objective of the puzzle is to fill the remaining &quot;open&quot;
    tiles or spaces in the grid so that each row, each column, and each of the 3x3 boxes (also called blocks)
    contains the digits 1 to 9 exactly once. HAVE FUN!</string>
