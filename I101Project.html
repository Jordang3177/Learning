<h1 class="centered">Project Proposal</h1>
<center class="maintext">High school reaches out to us because school wants to find ways to engage the student body with athletic and arts events. Attendance
 for these events has not been great so school want to encourage students to support their peers.
 </br>
Our team chose this problem because we thought this was an interesting problem and wanted to find the way to encourage
students for more participation on school events, which will lead students to have experience of school spirit.
</br>
To solve the problem, our team found related articles to see what kind of solutions are there and how effective they were. Also, we did survey to know what students and parents think about mobile app. After that,
 we discussed the solutions for high school to encourage students participation on school events. Our final solution was to build an mobile app to inform school events to students and parents. </center>s
