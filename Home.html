			<h1> About Me </h1>
			<p> I'm Jordan Graves, and I'm currently a student at Indiana University, Majoring in Computer Science with Minors in Mathematics and Informatics. I'm a Junior here in 2018 and I'm set to graduate in the Fall of 2019. I have a deep desire to learn more about Computer Programming languages and as such I am able to proficiently code in five different programming languages. But my desire to learn more about languages doesn't end with just programming languages, instead I also am learning Chinese in the hopes to live there one day. </p>
			<p> I have been doing Computer work since I was around twelve years old, <span id = "projects_section"> </span>because of the work that my uncle does. I was fascinated by the way that he was able to make seemingly anything with just the keyboard and computer, I wanted to have this sort of super power as well. And since then I've been driven by a desire to be able to develop and create wonderful things for people. </p>

						<h2> Flood-it </h2>
							<p><b> Project Description: </b> This is a game that you can play where you are looking to make the entire board become filled up with a single color. You start in the top right hand corner of the map and click on any color that you decide is the best choice and if the top right corner has any connections with the color you just selected, then those tiles will become part of the flooded region and this region will keep expanding till it fills up the whole board. For this project I was also required to make an algorithm that determined the fastest way to beat the game, and the way it did this was to first check the neighboring areas of the flooded region and figure out which color occured the most, and then it would select that color and keep doing this over and over again until the computer had beat the game. </p>

						<h2> Space Invaders </h2>
						<p> <b> Project Description: </b> In this project I was to use Dr.Rackets Big Bang operation. I had to handle all the images and the tick variables as they were going. So that the game would constantly keep moving and make the images ourselves rather than taking them from the internet or other places. So the images were made soley in Dr.Racket with the Image library in place. Then I had to make the mouse events happen each time that you were able to click on the screen it would shoot something down towards the aliens. Then If you were to click arrow keys or "ad" on your keyboard it would move the ship left or right. And as the game goes on the alien ships will continue to go up and try to attack your ship head on, and if they were to make contact with your ship then you would lose. The way that you win would be for you to shoot all the alien ships thus resulting there to be no ships left on the field of play. </p>
