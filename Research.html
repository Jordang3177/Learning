<p>  The Edweek article written by Kimberly Long talks about how getting the word about extracurricular activities out to school students is hard. He talks about the different ways to get students involved in the clubs. 

<br>
<br>

Long writes that getting a poster out or making an announcement is not enough. It is important to know the audience and promote events in a way that grab's the student's attention. This could include using the latest pop culture references, memes, etc. A better idea is to involve the students themselves and make them take ownership. It develops their leadership skills and they are more likely to promote and better a club they are part of. Lastly, he talks about building traditions in a club as students are likely to remember those experiences.

<br>
<br>

This article was helpful because it allows us to establish the groundwork for our scenario. Understanding how extracurriculars work in a school and how they can be improved is important. Keeping the points Long discusses in mind, we can work our Point Earning App more easily.

<p> This article is about the positive impact of parent engagement and how technology can improve parent involvement. More and more schools are trying to have better communication and relationships with parents with technology, such as websites, emails, and application that is designed for school. 
<br>
<br>
Technology allow parents and teachers communicate and allow parents to remind school events. By letting parents know what students are doing and what are they going to do, parents will feel they are connected to school. 
<br>
<br>
Since there are a lot of parent who are both working, there is a solution for them. Even they are away, or they couldn't join the school events, there is a technology that will connect them to school activities by video conference, social media and text message. 
<br>
<br>
To parents, it is important to know how their child are doing in school. But because of work or poor school system, it was hard for parents to join school activities. If parents start to have opportunity to connect with school, involvement of students and parents will be automatically increase.

<h4> Improving Student Engagement </h4>

<p> This article which is written by Jim Parsons, a professor for secondary education, and Leah Taylor, an educator and researcher, talks about how we can keep students engaged. Even though most of this paper talks about how to keep students engaged in the classroom, we can utilize these same ideas and tactics to make them engaged in the after-school events. In this paper they say that the best ways to keep a student engaged is that they have to have a sense of relationships with the people involved, have a sense of exploration as they are doing things, a feeling that what they are doing is relevant, and they have to be engaged and challenged with the object.
<br>
<br>
We can utilize the idea of having a sense of relationships by having teachers sponsor the app that we are going to be using, this way the students have a familiar face telling them that this app is something they should try and will help them become more familiar with the events they attend. The sense of Exploration can be achieved by the point system that we have for the app. The students will want to keep moving forward and they see their next goal for attending and participating in more events. In order to combat the feeling of relevance, we want to have the points they are gaining for attending move towards a goal that they care about. This can be through prizes that they deem to be worth their time and effort to go to these events, or extra credit in the classes they are taking that semester. And finally, the way that we can make it engaging and challenging, could be to have a leaderboard with the highest scoring students at the school. This would allow students to see who else is going to events while also they have a sense of competition when they are going to these events.  
<br>
<br>
In order to make an app that would make students engaged and attend, then we would need to have all the following criteria; of making it have a sense of relationship, a sense of exploration, a feeling of relevance, and a sense of a challenge to look forward to. We can do this by having the teachers sponsor our app, prizes that the students care about, and a leaderboard for a sense of competition among the student body. If we are to make an app that has all of this then according to Jim Parsons and Leah Taylor, then we would see an increase in both attendance and student engagement at these events.

<h2> Team Documentation </h2>

<p class="maintext">For this project the seemingly hardest part was coming up with the idea for the solution. Our main aim was to make sure that the students are not only motivated to go to the events but also enjoy attending them. Coming up with an idea that incorporates this idea was difficult. At the end, one of the team member came up with the idea for an app that provides incentives. 
<br>
<br>
While we were figuring out the incentives we had originally proposed alot of ideas, such as gift cards, extra credit in class, and the choice to miss certain classes after you gained enough points. But we took some of these ideas out in order to make it more about getting prizes rather than making it based on getting a better grade. Once the idea for the app was finalized, we had to determine what roles and how to split them. As a team we thought that we worked very well together and everyone did the part that was assigned to them. In the future, one thing that the group could have done differently would have been to split the design and presentation of the website up rather than have one person do all of that work. </p>
