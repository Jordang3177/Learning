# Problem 1 - Fringe Expansion
#################################
# Objective:
# 1) Write a function that adds the possible states that we can get to
#    from the current state to the end of the fringe.
#
# Notes:
# (1) This function should not return or yield anything but just update the contents of the fringe
# (2) board.slide_blank is error-safe. It will return None if it is impossible to slide the blank

# This will take all the possible moves for the board at the current state, and see which of those are possible.
# If they are possible, then it will be added to the fringe.

# Problem 2 - BFS
#################################
# Objectives:
# (1) Write a function that implements a single iteration of the BFS algorithm
#     by considering the first state from the fringe.
#     (Returns STOP if the fringe is empty.)
#     See the project documentation for more details.

# Does a single iteration for BFS
# First has to see if there is a fringe, if there isn't it returns STOP
# then if there is a fringe that means we can pop the first element and check that element to see the depth
# if the depth is bigger than the max depth given, then we need to just ignore it and continue
# next will check if the goal state is this state and if so we return that current state
# otherwise then we need to expand the fringe on that current state and return CONTINUE.

###########################################

#
# Notes:
# (1) It may be helpful to consult your solution for a1.compose here.

# then use the heuristic given on the board and the given goal_board, and add that value to the depth which is A*

# Problem 5 - Your Own Heuristic
#################################
# Objectives:
# (1) Write a function that takes current_board and goal_board as arguments and
#     returns an estimate of how many moves it will take to reach the goal board.
#     Your heuristic must be admissible (never overestimate cost to goal), but
#     it does not have to be consistent (never overestimate step costs).
#
# Notes:
# (1) This heuristic should be admissible, but greater than (closer to the real
#     value than) the manhattan distance heuristic on average. That makes it a
#     better heuristic.

# For this I'm using something found on stack overflow, at https://bit.ly/2SKz3DW
# I first had to do a for loop for all the possible elements in the 8-puzzle which are 1-8 inclusive.
# then for each element we had to find the location of it in the current state
# then we had to find the location of it's goal state
# then we use those locations and separate those tuples into individual values
# from there I then had to find the difference between the rows and take the absolute value
# then do the same for the columns.
# After this I followed the statement given in the link above, and simply messed around with the square root value
# because of the feedback from the grading tool, until I finally landed at 3.9999999
# and then returned the answer from that

# Problem 6 - Informed Expansion
#################################
# Objectives:
# (1) Write a function that expands the fringe using the f-value function
#     provided. Note that States automatically sort by their f-values.
#
# Notes:
# (1) This function should update the contents of the fringe using heapq.

# because the f_function takes a depth and that depth will be different than the current depth I had to add one to it.
