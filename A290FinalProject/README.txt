I would ask that what you look at be all the three games that I made, but only Sudoku, and TicTacToe have functionality, while Chess is only a board that does nothing else.

The Target AVD is the same one that we used in class.

I'm hoping that the images stay with the project as I upload them but if they do not then you can find them here: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:PNG_chess_pieces/Standard_transparent

Building, Running and Evaluating should be the same as any of the other projects. Just use the AVD that we did in class and run it.

Just a note there is currently a bug in the Exit buttons that I have listed in the UserGuide. Please read that as well and know that I'm working on a fix for this.

Thank you so much, and I hope you like what I've created.
