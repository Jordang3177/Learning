            <p>This is where we are now when you are looking at this. We have been apart for seven months now.
                You are working on your amazon seller with Ebay and Etsy as well. I'm trying to learn as much as I
                can in order to have a better future for us. I try to look at the green card application almost every day
                hoping that when I log into that page you will be able to come back to me. THank you for your christmas gift
                and I hope that you like yours as well honey. Love you so much and hope I can be with you very very soon!

                Hi! You kept scrolling and looking through the entire page, because of this I want to give you a little
                something extra. Send me a message on WeChat that says Chocolate Banana and I'll send you a little extra surprise.
                I love you baby and I hope I can see you soon!
