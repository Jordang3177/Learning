		<h2> JavaScript Questions </h2>
		<ul>
			<li> If you were to have n = 1 + 2 and displayed n then it would print out 3. And if you had n = "1" + "2" and displayed n then it would print out "12". The difference here is that when you use + on two integers or numbers then you will get the mathematical instance of that expression that you give it and when you give it a + on two strings then you will get a concatination of the two strings.</li>
			<li> += is an tool where if you say x += y then you would get x = x + y. So it allows you to add the current value that you have for the variable and add it to the variable that you are calling it, if you only had x = y. then that would make x be y, it wouldn't care about what is in x as long as it's the same type of y that you initialized x with. So with += you save the current variable and change it based on the new variable you are giving it</li>
			<li> The two pieces of code that we have used thus far for where our JavaScript numbers are going to occur are in script and /script tags as well as the function attribute and then whatever the name of the function </li>
		</ul>
		<script> 
			function count_it() {
				var max_num = document.getElementById("max_number").value;
				var numbers="";
				for(var i=1; i<=max_num; i++)
				{
					if((i % 2) == 0) {
						numbers += String(i) + "<br>"
					}
					else{
						numbers += String(i) + " ";
					}
				}
				document.getElementById("counter").innerHTML = numbers;
			}
		</script>
