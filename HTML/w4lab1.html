<p> Before this class I have coded before. I have coded in HTML, Java, and Scheme.</p>
<p> I got started with programming about three years ago. Back then I didn't enjoy it all that much, but about one or two years ago I really started to see what I can really do with programming so I changed my major to Computer Science.</p>
<p> Since i have been programming for three years I feel comfortable with programming. I might not know how to code in Python, but it doesn't seem to be much more difficult than Java, just have to learn the syntax for the language now.</p>
<p> The only really big question I have for this language and the next one that we will learn is whether or not Python is a Object Oriented language or is it a function oriented language. It seems to be function oriented, but I'm not too sure since we havn't done that much with it yet.</p>
<p>Process - How we do something/accolmplish something. </br> Program - A specific language that allows a process to occur. </br> Algorithm - A set of rules; description of a process. </br> To call - Have the program pull up something stored in its memory. </br> Command - Does something (ex. print). </br> Function - a piece of code that makes something happen. </br>Strings - any combination of lettes, numbers, etc... that are enclosed by quotations. </br> Variable - a symbolic name used to store and represent data/information to be used somewhere within a program. </p>
