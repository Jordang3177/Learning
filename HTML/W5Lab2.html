<p> What is a function? How do we create one? </br>
A function is a line or multiple lines of code that does something. We create one by using the define function in order to make one of our own. <p>
<p>Why are functions so useful? </br>
Funtions are useful because they allow us to create our own code or modify existing code.</p> 
<p>In your own words, describe what a loop is. </br>
A loop is a line of code that is constantly repeated until a certain set goal is achieved.</p> 
<p>How do loops help us in programming? Give us an example of when you would use a loop.</br> 
Loops can be extremly useful because we don't have to code out exactly everything but instead just code out a loop so that we can get what we want in a more timely and memory efficent manner. You can use loops in conditional statements such as nested if statements or nested and/or functions. This will make the program very quick and much more efficent with it's memory.</p>
