		<p> The correct syntax for a while loop would be to have the while loops condition
		so for instance you would have a boolean statement and it keeps going while that condition
		that you have given it is true. And once this condition is false it will stop the while loop.
		Then after the while loop's condition you would put the things that you want it to do while
		the loop is running. This should usually keep modifying the condition so that you don't get an
		infinite loop, either by having a user input manipulate what is in the boolean statement so that it
		can somehow become false, or you can have it be manipulated each time you have the while loop running
		and eventually you have it so that the while loop's condition will be met with false.</p>
		<p> One good use of the remove function in a program would be if you have a list of elements and
		you want to keep removing elements that is done or has been seen, so as you see this element in something else
		like a reading program or something of that nature, then you would remove that element from the list and
		keep going until it has seen everything that is in what you selected and then you can run this program twice
		and see what is in one text and what isn't in another or if all elements are in both texts.</p>
