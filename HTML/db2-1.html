		<li> The primary key for the students table is the ID. </li>
		<li>The two foreign keys are ID from the students table and the ClassID from the courses table.</li>
		<li> We are using the foreign and primary keys are as a reference point in takes_course table so that we can see which student is taking which class. </li>
		<li>What is the schema of the courses table? the schema for this table is all the elements of the top row, so together it is ClassID, Name, Course_Num, and Cred_hours. So this is the identity of the course that the student can take. When you look at all of them together you are seeing the identity of the course itself. </li>
