			<li> Argument - A value that is passed to a function </li>

		<p> It is important to keep track of data types because if you are able to understand what type
		data you are using then you will know the output and if you need to manipulate the output then 
		you need to know the original data type that the function was accepting. It's also important
		to know data types because you need to know what you are dealing with so you know what you can
		call when using certain data types. Like if you use + on integers or numbers it will
		calculate them and if you use them on Strings or characters it will concatenate them </p>
