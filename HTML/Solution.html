		<h2> The Problem:</h2>
		<p> Our former high school has been having an issue with student attendance and engagement at artistic and athletic events. The high school decided to reach out to us as they knew we were taking an informatics class in college and knew that we would be able to create a creative solution with the knowledge we have learned. </p>
		<ul>
		
		</ul>
	<h2> The Solution:</h2>
		<p> We came up with the idea of creating an app that will allow students to use the GPS on their phone to check into games, and as incur points each time they check in. The points can then be redeemed at the end of the period for prizes such as food or movie tickets. This solution will help address the problem as it will motivate students to come to events. These prizes will motivate students to come as our target market mainly consists of teenagers who dont have jobs or the money to buy these items normally.  Also, the more students that come to these events will create a snowball effect as they will tell all of their friends to come as well. This will also help engagement at these events as the longer students stay, the more points they will get from the event causing them to stay longer. </p>
		<ul>
		
		</ul>
	<h2> Addressing the Target Market:</h2>
		<p> The target market of this app will be current students and also parents at the school. We will advertise to this market through mediums such as the school announcements, posters, and promotions from local businesses. Targeting parents from the school will also help encourage students to attend events as parents will motivate their children to attend more events. This is shown in Curtiss Strietelmeier's research as he claims parents will more willingly encourage students to attend events when they know the details of whats going on. </p>
		<ul>
		
		</ul>
	<h2> How it Works: </h2>
		<p> This solution will work by having school students download the app, sign into their student accounts, and then when they are at events they can sign in on the app which will use the GPS on their phones to verify where they are. They can then accumulate points throughout the year and when the period is over they can redeem the points for prizes such as free food or things such as free movie tickets to a local theater. </p>
		<ul>
	
		</ul>
	<h2> Reaction to the Solution: </h2>
		<p> The student body reacted very positively to the release of the app. They were excited about all of the prizes they could win and were also excited to attend all these events with their friends. From our primary research, we found that we will incure a 75% approval rating for the app with the other 25% being a maybe. We also found that 67% of students will attend more events if there was an app that promoted the event. After the first semester of using the app student attendance went up an average of 47% and over 90% of the student body used the app at least once.  </p>
