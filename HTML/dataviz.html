<!-- Provide an introduction to your data/visualizations as well as an explanation of each data set or visualization.-->
<p> For this project it was very important for us to understand the environment and it's constituents. We merely did not want to 
focus on increasing the student participation without understanding why. We felt unless we did not understand the importance of
extracurricular ourselves, we will not be able to come up with the best app.</p>

<p> Apart from the research articles that we found <a href="Research.html">(Click here to learn about them!) </a>, we also found the following Infographics
that explains the importance of extracurriculars for children.</p>
<p> The Infographics were published by the Elkhart Education Foundation, a foundation that "supports excellence in education through the development and implementation of innovative academic programs and provides supplemental funds for character-building extracurricular activities."</p>

<h1> Survey Visualization</h1>

<p>  In our process of understanding the problem, we conducted a survey consisting of 5 thorough questions. We posted the survey on Survey Monkey and had 12 students respond to it at the end.
In our survey we found -
    <p>1) A 75% approval for our app with 25% of the students being a maybe.</p>
    <p>2) 67% of the students said they would be more inclined to attend school if their parents or teachers motivated them to do so. However, 17% disagreed</p>
    <p>3) Food from local vendors seemed to be the most popular prize item(42%) followed by movie tickets(33.3%) and donations to charities (16.7%). Game ticket prizes seemed to be the least popular(8.3%) </p>
    <p>4) 50% of the students said they rarely attend events. The remaining percentage mostly and usually attned them.</p>
    <p>5) Finally, 67% of the students agreed that an app that displays all the event will encourage them to attned events.</p>

<p> This survey showed us that our app does have the ability to make a positive impact. </p>
