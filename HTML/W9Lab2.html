<ul>
	<li>A primary key is something that contains a certain attribute that is able to associate that item to a specific person or object in the table. Every object only has one primary key and every primary key only has one object associated to it.</li>
    <li>This is usually used in other tables than the original table in order to link the two tables together so that way you have another table and are able to still refernece the items in the first table without putting them all on this other table entierly.</li>
    <li>To put it very simply Attributes are the columns of the tables and the Tuples are the rows of the table.</li>
    <li>SQL is Structured Query Language and it is used as a database language in order to simplify the organization and creation of databases.</li>
    <li>Antoher example of a primary key would be a phone number or an employee ID number. Anything can be used as a primary key but a primary key must be something that is unique to each person, an address can work but you have to be careful with this because multiple people can live at the same address.</li>
